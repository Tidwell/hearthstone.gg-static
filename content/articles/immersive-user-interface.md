At [Game Developers Conference 2015] [1] Hearthstone UI designer Derek Sakamoto gave an insightful talk about the design process behind itterating on Hearthstone's interface.  His talk shows a number of early design concepts and explores several of the options Blizzard researched during pre-alpha development.  I highly recommend you check out the video, then take a look at the insights we have gleamed from the talk.
