In August 2014 [Gamasutra] [1] released a video from the [Game Developers Conference] [2] of a talk by former Blizzard developer Brian Schwab.  There are some very interesting points Brian discusses, and his slides give a unique behind-the-scenes look at some of the tools Blizzard uses to create Hearthstone content.  I highly recommend you check out the video, then take a look at the insights we have gleamed from the [slides] [3].
