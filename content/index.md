Hearthstone.gg
--

Evergreen Hearthstone content focused on design, tooling, and documentation.

Hearthstone.gg features articles focusing on public announcements by blizzard, discovered facts and insights, and the technical construction of the game.  If you want to explore the game under the hood, or gain more insight into blizzard's design methodology - these are the articles you are looking for.

Hearthstone.gg focuses on Hearthstone content unrelated to deckbuilding, the metagame, card reviews, or tournament recaps.  Plenty of great sites focus on those aspects of the game - we do not.
